Image Cloud
===========

This small app lets you browse through the img.ly picture stream in 3D!
Geared by the powerful three.js library and with additional WebGL-shaders.

Usage
-----

The app has been tested on the Chrome browser.
Currently you have to make sure to enable cross-domain WebGL textures by using the argument
	
	--disable-web-security
	
when starting chrome until cross-domain texture-support is added to img.ly.
